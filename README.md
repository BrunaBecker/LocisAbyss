 ## **Loci's Abyss** is a small game made with Pygame for a final project for college
 
 Loci's Abyss was developed by Elisa Costa and Bruna Becker, two Computer Science students at Fluminense Federal University. The development was made with the Pygame framework, the Tiled Level Editor coupled with the PyTMX library, and public/free licensed assets available on the internet - all properly credited in a following section.

# Controls:

`start`: Confirm in menus.

`WASD` and the `arrow keys`: in-game movement. 

`e` or `spacebar`: Attack in-game.

`esc`: Quits game completely.


# Requirements:

To play Loci's Abyss, you will need to have Python and the Pygame Framework (version 2.0.1 or above). Everything else is provided by the source code itself.

This game is compatible with both Windows and Linux.

# How to Play 

Download the source code from the [GitHub](https://github.com/BrunaBecker/LocisAbyss) or [Itch.io](https://brunaeelisa.itch.io/locis-abyss) page.
Then, to launch the game --

... If you're on Windows:
execute the loci.cmd file (which is the same as launching main.py itself).

...Or if you're Linux:
execute the loci.sh file (again, the same as launching main.py).
